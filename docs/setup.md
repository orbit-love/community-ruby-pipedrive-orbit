# First Time Setup

<!-- This is a summary section. Explain what we need to do at a high-level. For example... -->

During the setup, we will need to create a new application on Stack Apps which will allow this integration to interact with the platform. The application will contain a Key which we should take note of for later.

1. Head to [Stack Apps](https://stackapps.com) and login in to your account.
2. [Register a new Stack Apps application](https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register). The oauth domain can be anything, as can the application website.
3. In your application settings, take note of your `Key` value.
